    Sales has always been more than just a career for me—it’s a craft, an art, and a constant game of strategy that I’ve come to love. But what I’ve found even more fulfilling than closing deals myself is helping others develop the skills and confidence to do the same. That’s why sales mentoring has become such an important part of my life. It started informally, just offering advice to colleagues or new hires who struggled to find their footing in the fast-paced world of selling. Over time, I realized how much I enjoyed guiding others, sharing what I’ve learned, and watching them turn their challenges into successes.

    What draws me to sales mentoring is the transformation I get to witness in people. Sales can be intimidating at first—handling objections, negotiating, and maintaining resilience in the face of rejection isn’t easy. But with the right mindset and strategy, anyone can become great at it. I love working with people to refine their pitch, develop confidence in their approach, and understand that sales isn’t about pushing a product—it’s about solving a problem. Seeing mentees go from hesitant and unsure to closing deals with confidence is an incredible feeling, and knowing I played a small part in that journey makes it all the more rewarding.

    Beyond helping others, mentoring has also made me a better salesperson. Teaching forces me to constantly refine my own skills, stay up to date on industry trends, and think critically about the strategies I use. It keeps me engaged and reminds me of the fundamentals that can sometimes get overlooked in the rush of daily business. More than that, it has expanded my network and introduced me to so many incredible people who share my passion for growth. Whether it’s through one-on-one coaching, hosting workshops, or simply being there for someone who needs guidance, sales mentoring has become a meaningful hobby that I can’t imagine giving up.
